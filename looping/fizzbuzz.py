# Problem: FizzBuzz

# Complete the function below. For a number N, print all the numbers starting
# from 1 to N, except
# 1. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz"
# 2. For numbers divisible by 5, print "Buzz"
# 3. For numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"

# Example:
# Input: N = 20
# Output: 
# 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, 
# FizzBuzz, 16, 17, Fizz, 19, Buzz
